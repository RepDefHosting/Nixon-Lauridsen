United Way of Central Iowa has served its community for over a century, providing funds and addressing social and economic challenges. Investing in scores of local nonprofit programs that address essential needs, early childhood development, education, health, and well-being, United Way delivers equitable opportunities for Central Iowans.



In January, United Way released Advocacy Agenda 2025, which lays out its legislative priorities. The organization seeks to bring systemic change to public policy. United Way supports the OpportUNITY Affordable Housing Workgroup, which provides families with achievable, cost-effective pathways toward homeownership.



For some, access to housing requires expunging records of eviction proceedings. Others, such as individuals without homes, require supportive, permanent housing. United Way collaborates with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, including its Fostering Economic Mobility Workgroup.



In addition, United Way aids food security efforts by funding the Healthiest State Initiative, which runs Double Up Food Bucks. This program helps recipients choose fresh, nutritious vegetables and fruits. Feeding America estimates that 10 percent of the general population and 14 percent of children under 18 (23,000 kids) experience food insecurity.



United Way of Central Iowa wants to improve access to quality, affordable childcare and address critical shortages in the childcare workforce. The organization is advocating for state income tax exemptions for childcare providers and expansion of the pilot Childcare Assistance program. Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers show that childcare workers earn $4,500 less than the central Iowan living wage, possibly resulting in a shortage of childcare professionals. Polk County has only half as many licensed childcare workers as needed.



United Way advocates for increasing all-day preschool availability and has collaborated with the Coalition to Advance Mental Health in Iowa for Kids (CAMHI4KIDS) on impactful mental health programs. On average, children who rely on Medicaid must wait three months for an appointment with a new mental health provider. United Way also works with the Oral Health Iowa coalition to promote the importance of tooth care.



In education, United Way seeks to implement work-based learning programs and expand credit-for-learning opportunities beyond the classroom. The organization also supports making more instructional resources available to English-language learners. Statistics show that 6.6 percent of 16- to 19-year-olds do not attend school or work and may benefit from opportunities that offer alternatives to delinquency.



United Way also stands behind investments in skilled workers through adult basic education, partnerships with industry participants, and GAP tuition assistance. United Way of Central Iowa aims to bring new flexibility to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding so workers can gain new and relevant skills in the fast-evolving workplace.



As detailed in the United Way Community Report, these challenges are larger than a single individual, family, or organization. Moreover, each sends ripples through the community that affect other aspects of life and well-being. United Way of Central Iowa has a distinct role as a convener, bringing together multiple community and nonprofit voices to forge solutions that combine talents, resources, and vision. Through these coordinated efforts, the nonprofit creates a cohesive and responsive strategy to meet diverse peopleâ€™s needs.
