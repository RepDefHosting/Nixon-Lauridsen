Based in Des Moines, Iowa, [Nixon Lauridsen](https://www.principalpost.com/in-brief/nixon-lauridsen) established the Lauridsen Group (LGI), which he led as the company’s CEO for four decades. He is retired from a group of companies that is still family owned and operated, and has its roots in a Dedham creamery that produced quality eggs, poultry, and butter across much of the 20th century. In the mid-1970s, Nixon Lauridsen partnered with his father Wally in repositioning the company toward the dairy and meat byproduct sector.

Today, the LGI corporate footprint spans a half-dozen independently operated enterprises guided by [Nixon Lauridsen](https://ideamensch.com/nixon-lauridsen/)’s daughter. These include Boyer Valley Company, which delivers ingredients used in producing animal feed, fertilizers, aquaculture, and renewable fuels. Proliant Dairy Ingredients delivers next generation dairy ingredients, including deproteinized whey, which add nutritional value to quality products for humans and animals.

Nix Lauridsen maintains a strong community presence and contributed a $1 million leadership gift with his wife Virginia in support of the Lauridsen Opera Center’s restoration, renovation, and expansion. He has also contributed to the Carnegie Library and its all-glass, contemporary Robert L. Larsen Atrium addition.
