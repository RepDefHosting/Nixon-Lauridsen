Based in Des Moines, Iowa, Nixon Lauridsen established the Lauridsen Group (LGI), which he led as the company’s CEO for four decades. He is retired from a group of companies that is still family owned and operated, and has its roots in a Dedham creamery that produced quality eggs, poultry, and butter across much of the 20th century. In the mid-1970s, Nixon Lauridsen partnered with his father Wally in repositioning the company toward the dairy and meat byproduct sector.
